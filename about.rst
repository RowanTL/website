Hello! My name is Rowan.

I graduated from the Missouri University of Science and Technology in December of 2024 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science.
I haven't nailed my exact passion in Computer Science, but I enjoy various aspects of the landscape such as Genetic Programming,
using various linux systems such as QubesOS, NixOS, hosting services such as git servers, this website, nextcloud instances, bitwarden instances,
and much more.

My hobbies include Rock Climbing, Yoga, Racquetball, and Programming :).
